# C++ and Linux Learning Plan for Adaptive AUTOSAR

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in C++, Linux, and Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), along with Adaptive AUTOSAR development. The plan is to upskill in modern C++ and Linux while simultaneously gaining hands-on experience in AGL and Adaptive AUTOSAR over the next 60 days.

## Learning Goals

1. **C++ Fundamentals**:
   - Basics of modern C++ (variables, functions, control flow)
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP), classes, inheritance
   - Advanced C++ concepts (templates, STL, smart pointers, RAII)

2. **Linux Essentials**:
   - Master basic Linux commands
   - Learn shell scripting, build tools like Make, CMake, and Git

3. **Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) & Adaptive AUTOSAR**:
   - Set up AGL development environment
   - Develop services on AGL platform
   - Learn Adaptive AUTOSAR architecture and communication (SOME/IP, ara::com)

4. **Final Projects**:
   - Build a complete project integrating C++, Linux, and Adaptive AUTOSAR.

## Progress Tracking

I will be using GitHub Issues and Projects to track my learning tasks and progress.
